# Course 3: Data Science Methodology

**About this Course**

If there is a shortcut to becoming a Data Scientist, then learning to think and work like a successful Data Scientist is it. In this course, you will learn and then apply this methodology that you can use to tackle any Data Science scenario. You’ll explore two notable data science methodologies, Foundational Data Science Methodology, and the six-stage CRISP-DM data science methodology, and learn how to apply these data science methodologies. Most established data scientists follow these or similar methodologies for solving data science problems.

Begin by learning about forming the business/research problem Learn how data scientists obtain, prepare, and analyze data. Discover how applying data science methodology practices helps ensure that the data used for problem-solving is relevant and properly manipulated to address the question. Next, learn about building the data model, deploying that model, data storytelling, and obtaining feedback You’ll think like a data scientist and develop your data science methodology skills using a real-world inspired scenario through progressive labs hosted within Jupyter Notebooks and using Python.

### Module 1: From Problem to Approach and From Requirements to Collection
In this module, you will discover what makes data science interesting, learn what a data science methodology is, and why data scientists need a data science methodology. Next, you’ll gain more in-depth knowledge of the first two data science methodology stages: Business Understanding and Analytic Approach. You’ll discover how to identify considerations and steps needed to define the data requirements for decision tree classification during the Data Requirements stage. Next, learn about the processes and techniques data scientists use to assess data content, quality, and initial insights and how data scientists manage data gaps. Round out this week with practical hands-on experience learning how to approach the Business Understanding and the Analytic Approach stage tasks and the Data Requirements and Collection stage tasks for any data science problem.

### Module 2: From Understanding to Preparation and From Modeling to Evaluation
In this module, you will learn what data scientists do when their tasks and goals are to understand, prepare, and clean the data. You’ll examine the purposes, characteristics, and goals of the data modeling process. You’ll also explore how to prepare a data set by handling missing, invalid, or misleading data.

Then check out the hands-on labs where you can gain experience completing tasks relevant to the Data Understanding, Data Preparation, and Modeling and Evaluation stages. You’ll be able to apply the skills you learn to future data science problems.

### Module 3: From Deployment to Feedback and Final Evaluation
When you complete this module, you’ll be able to describe the deployment and feedback stages of the data science methodology. You’ll learn how to assess a data model’s performance, impact, and readiness. You’ll be able to identify the stakeholders who usually contribute to model refinement. You’ll also be able to explain why deployment and feedback should be an iterative process.

To complete your hands-on lab experience, you’ll devise a business problem to solve using data related to email, hospitals, or credit cards. You’ll demonstrate your understanding of data science methodology by applying it to a given problem. You’ll construct responses that address each phase of the CRISP-DM based on a chosen business problem. After submitting your work, you’ll evaluate your peers’ final projects and provide constructive ideas and suggestions that fellow learners can apply right away.

### Module 4: Final Project and Assessment
Before completing your final project, learn how CRISP-DM data science methodology compares to John Rollins’ foundational data science methodology. Then, apply what you learned to complete a peer-graded assignment using CRISP-DM data science methodology to solve a business problem you define. You'll first take on both the client and data scientist role and describe how you would apply CRISP-DM data science methodology to solve the business problem.

Then, take on the role of a data scientist and apply your knowledge of CRISP-DM data methodology stages to describe how you would solve the business problem. After you submit your assignment, you'll grade the assignment of one peer who is enrolled in this session. Let's get started!
